\title{Retrieves partition metadata from the Data Catalog that contains
unfiltered metadata}
\usage{
glue_get_unfiltered_partitions_metadata(
  CatalogId,
  DatabaseName,
  TableName,
  Expression = NULL,
  AuditContext = NULL,
  SupportedPermissionTypes,
  NextToken = NULL,
  Segment = NULL,
  MaxResults = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{CatalogId}{[required] The ID of the Data Catalog where the partitions in question reside. If
none is provided, the AWS account ID is used by default.}

\item{DatabaseName}{[required] The name of the catalog database where the partitions reside.}

\item{TableName}{[required] The name of the table that contains the partition.}

\item{Expression}{An expression that filters the partitions to be returned.

The expression uses SQL syntax similar to the SQL \code{WHERE} filter clause.
The SQL statement parser
\href{https://jsqlparser.sourceforge.net/home.php}{JSQLParser} parses the
expression.

\emph{Operators}: The following are the operators that you can use in the
\code{Expression} API call:

\strong{=}

Checks whether the values of the two operands are equal; if yes, then
the condition becomes true.

Example: Assume 'variable a' holds 10 and 'variable b' holds 20.

(a = b) is not true.

\strong{\< \>}

Checks whether the values of two operands are equal; if the values are
not equal, then the condition becomes true.

Example: (a \< \> b) is true.

\strong{\>}

Checks whether the value of the left operand is greater than the value
of the right operand; if yes, then the condition becomes true.

Example: (a \> b) is not true.

\strong{\<}

Checks whether the value of the left operand is less than the value of
the right operand; if yes, then the condition becomes true.

Example: (a \< b) is true.

\strong{\>=}

Checks whether the value of the left operand is greater than or equal to
the value of the right operand; if yes, then the condition becomes true.

Example: (a \>= b) is not true.

\strong{\<=}

Checks whether the value of the left operand is less than or equal to
the value of the right operand; if yes, then the condition becomes true.

Example: (a \<= b) is true.

\strong{AND, OR, IN, BETWEEN, LIKE, NOT, IS NULL}

Logical operators.

\emph{Supported Partition Key Types}: The following are the supported
partition keys.
\itemize{
\item \code{string}
\item \code{date}
\item \code{timestamp}
\item \code{int}
\item \code{bigint}
\item \code{long}
\item \code{tinyint}
\item \code{smallint}
\item \code{decimal}
}

If an type is encountered that is not valid, an exception is thrown.}

\item{AuditContext}{A structure containing Lake Formation audit context information.}

\item{SupportedPermissionTypes}{[required] A list of supported permission types.}

\item{NextToken}{A continuation token, if this is not the first call to retrieve these
partitions.}

\item{Segment}{The segment of the table's partitions to scan in this request.}

\item{MaxResults}{The maximum number of partitions to return in a single response.}
